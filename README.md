# SN-BASED EMULATING FRAMEWORK

This repository contains a P/T nets emulating framework based on [Symmetric Nets](https://www.iso.org/standard/52070.html).
The work introducing these models has been submitted for publication at the 14th Workshop on Discrete Event Systems ([WODES2018](http://wodes2018.unisa.it/)).

All the models can be opened and simulated/analyzed by using the [GreatSPN](http://www.di.unito.it/~amparore/mc4cslta/editor.html) software tool.

### Content:

*    `EmulatorV2_1.PNPRO`: emulator model introduced in Sect. 3 (See Fig. 1);
*    `EmulatorV2_2.PNPRO`: emulator model variant that makes use of *ordering*/*partitioning* of basic classes;
*    `EmulatorV2_3.PNPRO`: emulator model variant that makes use of *Structural techniques*;
*    `EmulatorCaseStudyV2.PNPRO`: the evolving philosophers example based on the emulator `V2_3`.
